Explanation of derivative files
------------
derivatives/sub*/anat/disc_labels_edited.nii.gz: disc labels based on T2-weighted anatomical images obtained using SCT’s "sct_label_vertebrae" function (manually modified where necessary); used for normalization of anatomical images to the PAM50 template space. 
derivatives/sub*/func/*_moco2_mean_seg.nii.gz: manual segmentation of the spinal cord (created based on the motion-corrected mean of each functional run); used for normalization of EPI data to the PAM50 template space.
derivatives/sub*/physio/sub*_physio_table.csv: physiological time-series(ECG and respiratory recordings), manually selected R peaks and, scanner triggers for functional runs.
derivatives/sub*/physio/*_physio_table.txt: manually selected R peaks, respiratory recordings, and scanner triggers for each functional run used for FSL PNM ev creation (contains same data as above-mentioned *.csv file- formatted for PNM).
derivatives/FeatModels/: template FSL Feat .fsf files used for each denoising pipeline.
derivatives/dsgn.txt: Feat ev design files used for denoising (see above-mentioned .fsf files).

------------
Please note that a copy of the PAM50 template that was used for normalization is also shared for reproducibility of the results ("derivatives", "PAM50").
